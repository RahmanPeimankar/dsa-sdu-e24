Course description:Welcome to Algorithms and Data Structures course. In this course, you will learn the step-by-step process that helps you applying well-known Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in Python ecosystem effectively. This course specifically focuses on preparing you with the right tools and knowledge to apply DSA. In this course, we will be familiar with DSA techniques to solve real-world problems.Course goals:This course is intended to train students to:•be able to use Python syntax for object-oriented programming•select and apply different data structures in Python•select and apply some of the common sorting algorithms•collaborate in development of a Python program for a domain-specificproblem•independently apply Python tools in complex developmental tasks
